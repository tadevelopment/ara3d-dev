* 3dsMaxSamples - Sample C# scripts that work in 3ds Max with the Ara3D Script Editor
* BFast - A fast and simple serializer and deserializer for binary arrays. 
* DotNetUtilities - A collection of useful .NET data types, functions, and extension methods
* G3D - A data format for efficient transmission, serialization, and deserialization of arbitrary 3D geometry data.
* G3SharpBridge - Converter functions and adpater classes between Ara3D data types and Geometry3Sharp data types
* Geometry - A library of 3D geometry interfaces, classes, and functions 
* LinqArray - A LINQ style library for arrays that supports efficient indexing and slicing
* Math3D - A library of math function and data types useful for 3D programming
* Parakeet - A PEG (Parsing Expression Grammar) recursive descent parsing library 
* ScriptEditor - A Scintilla based editor that runs in its own process designed to be integrated into other applications (like 3ds Max)
* Tests - All of the happy little tests in one place
